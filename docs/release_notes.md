# upcoming release

## New features
* `centroids_of_labels` was GPU-accelerated.
* `statistics_of_labelled_pixels` and `statistics_of_background_and_labelled_pixels` contain the parameter `standard_deviation_intensity` now.
* `statistics_of_labelled_pixels` and `statistics_of_background_and_labelled_pixels` are now GPU-accelerated. The 
results of the GPU-accelerated statistics are dictionaries which contain the same measurements as in CLIJ2.

### New operations

### Backwards compatibility breaking changes
* `statistics_of_labelled_pixels` and `statistics_of_background_and_labelled_pixels` produce different output now. 
Instead of a scikit-image RegionProps objects, the produce a dictionary which contains lists of measurements. 
`push_regionprops_column` also works with the new output format. Consider updating your code to work with the 
dictionaries,e.g. `stats['area']` instead of `[s.area for s in stats]`. If not possible, use the new function 
`regionprops` retrieve results in the old format
* `n_closest_points` ignores the background position and the distance to labels themselves per default now. 
  Consider passing `ignore_background=False` and `ignore_self=False` to go back to former functionality.

### Deprecation warnings
* `resample` has been deprecated. Use `scale` instead.

### Bug fixes
* `imshow` in 3D caused an error
* `push_regionprops_column` didn't actually push

### Miscellaneous
* `flag_existing_intensities` has been renamed to `flag_existing_labels`. An alias to the old method was created to keep backwards-compatibility

# 0.6.0 - Christmas 2020

## New features
* Operations can be categorized now. That allows generating handy user interfaces (74c82f0, d03fc2d). For example, you can retrieve a dictionary with all `background removal` operations indiced with their names by calling:
```
import pyclesperanto_prototype as cle
dict = cle.operations(must_have_categories=['background removal'])
```
* Internal support for clImages. This allows acceleated interpolation, which is necessary, e.g. for the new `resample` operation. (075250c)
* Implemented image-size independent kernel compilation. This should improve performance of operations significantly, where typically images of various sizes are processed.
For example operations working with distance matrices and point lists. (d897863)
* `cle.functions` now have a parameter fullargspec to enable better automatic GUI generation for them (119cee3)
* We're working with a version controlled `release_notes` file now. Let's see how this evolves.

## Backwards compatibility breaking changes
* the behaviour of `exclude_labels` is inverted now 
* The implementation of `label_spots` changed. It's now comparable with CLIJ2.
* `set_nonzero_pixels_to_pixelindex` was renamed to `set_non_zero_pixels_to_pixel_index`

## Deprecations
* As an answer to [Issue #49](https://github.com/clEsperanto/pyclesperanto_prototype/issues/49), 
the `push` and `pull` commands warn now about deprecation. In a future release, we may remove the transposition so that
`push` does the same as `push_zyx`, and `pull` does the same as `pull_zyx`.

## Bugfixes
* automatic `create*` functions failed when only `kwargs` were passed to any operation (d033fed, 4fd6099)
* `divide_by_gaussian_background` didn't divide, it was in fact the implementation of `subtract_gaussian_background` (a6b0dd0)
* before drawing a mesh, all pixels are set to 0 (9433a2f, 52572a6)
* the behaviour of `exclude_labels` was inverse (3c9f5b1, fd5d98b)
* in `exclude_labels` background was added to label 1 in case it was kept (439dba5)
* `detect_maxima_box` had missing parameters compared to the CLIJ2 API
